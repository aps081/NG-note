Trying to replicate google keep

Hi guys,
This is just a small effort by me trying to replicate the google keep website (https://keep.google.com/).
I know it is nowhere near to what it should actually look like, but with my usual office work I try to give some time to this.
So it is taking time and I also have very less experience in angular.

This application is built using angular.
You can check how to setup and angular project in the official angular website (angular.io)

I am still working on this and you can expect more commits.
